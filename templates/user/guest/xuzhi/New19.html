        The weekly infection growth rate on Saturday was 1.73, up from Friday's 1.69. The statistic - viewed by authorities as a key indicator in calibrating COVID-19 measures - refers to the ratio of community cases for the past week over the week before.
</p>

        <p class="text3">

A rate of more than 1 means that the number of new weekly cases is rising. The weekly infection growth rate surpassed 1 for the first time since Nov 12 on Tuesday.

As of Saturday, Singapore has recorded 284,802 COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic.
