  <h2 class="header"> Symptoms</h2>
  <p class="text1">

    Persons infected with the Omicron variant can present with symptoms similar to previous variants. The presence and
    severity of symptoms can be affected by COVID-19 vaccination status, the presence of other health conditions, age,
    and history of prior infection.
  </p>

  <p class="text1">
    Over the past week, hospitals across the island said they have seen a higher number of patients seeking medical
    attention at their emergency rooms.

    Khoo Teck Puat Hospital told CNA that the average daily attendance at its emergency department rose by 20 per cent
    in the first week of February compared with January.

    Of the patients who walked into its emergency room that week, 66 per cent were discharged without being
    hospitalised, said its spokesperson.

    At Singapore General Hospital (SGH), the emergency department is seeing a “higher than usual” daily patient average
    than in the past two years, said Associate Professor Kenneth Tan, head and senior consultant at SGH’s emergency
    medicine department.

    Patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infections doubled during and after the first two days of Chinese New
    Year, of which more than 60 per cent were either eligible for the home recovery programme, sent to isolation
    facilities in the community, or discharged after their visit.

    The Ministry of Health (MOH) over the weekend urged the public to seek emergency treatment at hospitals only for
    serious or life-threatening emergencies, amid a rise in the number of such patients.

    Most of the patients who visited hospital emergency departments in recent weeks did not require emergency care, it
    added.

    Hospitals that CNA spoke to urged patients with mild symptoms to visit their nearest clinics instead of jamming up
    emergency departments.

    “Only people with serious or life-threatening emergencies, such as chest pain, breathlessness and uncontrollable
    bleeding, should visit the hospital’s emergency department as this allows those in need of emergency care to be
    attended to quickly and helps to preserve the hospital’s capacity for those who truly need acute hospital care,”
    said Associate Professor Thomas Loh, group chairman of the medical board for the National University Health System
    (NUHS).

    NUHS manages National University Hospital (NUH), Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Alexandra Hospital.

  <h2 class="header">INCREASED WAITING TIMES</h2>
  <p class="text2">

    Emergency department staff that CNA spoke to said waiting times have increased by at least 20 minutes to a few hours
    for mild cases. In some instances, patients have had to wait as long as 20 hours to get a placement in a ward.

    Among hospitals tracked by the Ministry of Health (MOH), latest figures show that daily bed occupancy rates ranged
    from 61.5 per cent to 100 per cent between Jan 23 and 29.
  </p>


  <h2 class="header"> Treatments</h2>
  <p class="text2">
    Scientists are working to determine how well existing treatments for COVID-19 work. Some, but not all, monoclonal
    antibody treatments remain effective against Omicron. Public health agencies work with healthcare providers to
    ensure that effective treatments are used appropriately to treat patients.
  </p>


  <h2 class="header"> How to protect yourself</h2>
  <p class="text3">
    Get vaccinated. The best way to stop viruses from mutating is to slow their spread, and the best way to slow their
    spread is through vaccination. Scientists are confident the existing vaccines will continue to offer protection
    against severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19.

    And there’s another bright spot: Scientists are learning more about booster shots, and it appears the booster does
    more than just “top off” antibody levels. It might even help broaden your defenses in a way that offers protection
    against omicron and future variants. Learn more about boosters.

    So, the message on vaccines is simple: Everyone 5 and older should get vaccinated, and boosters are recommended for
    everyone 12 and older. Find a vaccinator near you.

    Masking and distancing. These public health measures, along with good hand hygiene, are proven to reduce infection
    from a variety of viruses, including the coronavirus. Wearing a mask or keeping your distance is another way to
    prevent spread and, by extension, deny the virus a chance to survive and spread.

  <h2 class="header"> How serious is the omicron variant?</h2>
  <p class="text4">


    Each coronavirus variant includes mutations that help the virus to survive and spread. For instance, before omicron,
    the delta variant had the most known mutations, and it was the most contagious variant.

    Scientists have identified many more mutations in omicron, including nearly 30 that are unique to this variant, that
    make the virus more contagious. Although it spreads more easily than past coronavirus variants, there are still
    details about it that remain unknown, including whether it causes more severe illness.

    The good news is that there’s no reason to panic. We already have ways to protect ourselves from the omicron
    variant.
