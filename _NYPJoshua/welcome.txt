Put your files in here, if your scared of conflicting files!
This will be a preparation for Integration Testing

from Joshua:

what is inside css folder: my css for guest store

what is inside GuestStore folder: html templates for guest store

what is inside python folder: what i added to the respective python files

what is inside staff inventory: my edit of staffinventory.html, the templates for editing(deleting and updating) products and my old retrieve_products.html. note: all of the paths for render template and @app.route may need changing

products.db is the products database, which currently does not hold alot of products

filler.jpg is just a fake photo for products for now since the uploading photoes is not working
